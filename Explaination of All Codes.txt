2)Write a program to implement an address book with options given below: a) Create 
address book. b) View address book. c) Insert a record. d) Delete a record. e) Modify 
a record. f) Exit
Write a program in such a way for ubuntu such that output is very precise but the code is very small

--> Explanation:
Structures:

The Record structure holds a name and details field for each contact in the address book.
Functions:

create_address_book(): Initializes (creates) the address book by opening the file in write-binary mode.
view_address_book(): Displays the records stored in the address book.
insert_record(): Adds a new record at the end of the file.
delete_record(): Deletes a record by searching for the name, creating a temporary file, and rewriting the rest of the records.
modify_record(): Searches for the name and modifies the corresponding details in the record.
File Handling:

The program uses fopen to open and manipulate files in read, write, and append modes.
A temporary file is used for deletion and modification operations to avoid directly modifying the original file while reading from it.
Menu:

The user is presented with a simple menu to create, view, insert, delete, or modify the address book.
Exit:

The program allows exiting and terminates gracefully.

File handling:

File handling is simplified by using open_file() for every file operation, ensuring that files are always opened safely with appropriate modes ("rb", "wb", "ab").


----------------------------------------------------------------------



3) Implement the C program in which main program accepts the integers to be sorted. 
Main program uses the FORK system call to create a new process called a child 
process. Parent process sorts the integers using sorting algorithm and waits for child 
process using WAIT system call to sort the integers using any sorting algorithm. Also 
demonstrate zombie and orphan states.


--> 
Explanation:
Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort is used by the parent process.
Selection Sort is used by the child process.
FORK and WAIT:

fork() is used to create a child process. The parent process and child process execute independently.
In the parent process, after sorting, wait() is used to ensure the parent waits for the child to finish before exiting. This prevents the child from becoming a zombie process.
If wait() is omitted, the child process will terminate but remain in the system as a zombie until the parent calls wait().
If the parent exits before the child process finishes, the child will become an orphan and will be adopted by the init process.
Zombie Process:

If you remove wait() in the parent process, the child becomes a zombie after it exits.
A zombie process is a terminated child process that still has an entry in the process table, awaiting the parent to collect its exit status.
Orphan Process:

If the parent process exits before the child, the child will be an orphan, and it will be adopted by the init process (with PID 1).

Zombie: A child process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table because its parent hasn't called wait() yet.
Orphan: A child process whose parent has terminated, and the child is adopted by init (PID 1).



---------------------------------------------------------------------



4) Implement the C program in which main program accepts an array. Main program 
uses the FORK system call to create a new process called a child process. Parent 
process sorts an array and passes the sorted array to child process through the 
command line arguments of EXECVE system call. The child process uses EXECVE 
system call to load new program which display array in reverse order.


-->
To implement the C program where the parent process sorts an array and passes the sorted array to the child process via the execve() system call, we need to break down the steps as follows:

Steps:
Parent Process:

Accepts an array of integers.
Sorts the array using a sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort).
Passes the sorted array to the child process through command line arguments when calling execve().
Child Process:

Receives the sorted array as command line arguments.
Loads a new program (which can be the same program) using execve() to display the array in reverse order.
Code Structure:
Parent Process: Sorts the array and uses execve() to pass the sorted array to the child process.
Child Process: Reverses the sorted array and displays it.
Parent and Child Program (main.c and reverse.c)
main.c (Parent Process):

Explanation:
Sorting: The parent process accepts an array of integers and sorts it using the bubble_sort() function.

execve(): The sorted array is converted to string arguments and passed to the child process via the execve() system call. execve() replaces the child process with a new program, in this case, a program named reverse (defined in another file reverse.c).

Child Process: The child process receives the sorted array as command line arguments and displays it in reverse order.

reverse.c (Child Process):

Explanation of reverse.c (Child Process):
Command Line Arguments: The child process receives the sorted array as command line arguments (after the program name).
Display in Reverse: It prints the integers in reverse order using a loop that starts from the last argument passed to execve() (ignoring the program name).

execve(): The child process is replaced by the reverse program when execve() is called. It receives the sorted array as command-line arguments.
Memory Allocation: The sorted array elements are converted into strings using sprintf() and passed as arguments to the child program.
Forking: The fork() system call creates a child process. The parent waits for the child to finish using wait().



------------------------------------------------------------------



5) Implement the C program for CPU Scheduling Algorithms: Shortest Job First 
(Preemptive ) with different arrival time.

-->
In a Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm, the CPU selects the process with the shortest burst time (execution time) to execute. If a new process arrives with a shorter burst time than the current process, the CPU preempts the current process and starts executing the new process.

Key Concepts:
Preemptive SJF (Shortest Job First): When a new process arrives with a shorter remaining burst time than the currently executing process, the CPU will preempt the currently running process and execute the new process. This continues until all processes are completed.
Arrival Time: Each process has a specific arrival time, and the processes may arrive at different times.
Burst Time: The total time required by the process for execution.
Approach to Solve:
Input: Each process has an arrival time, burst time, and an ID.
Scheduling: At every point, select the process with the shortest burst time that is ready to execute (i.e., has already arrived).
Preemption: If a new process arrives with a shorter burst time than the remaining time of the process that is currently running, the running process will be preempted and placed back in the queue.
Steps:
We first need to sort the processes by arrival time.
Then, simulate the process execution by tracking the time and preempting processes if necessary.

Explanation:
Input: The program first accepts the number of processes (n) and their arrival time and burst time.
Sorting: It sorts the processes based on their arrival times to handle the order in which they arrive.
Preemptive SJF Scheduling:
The calculate_times() function simulates the preemptive SJF scheduling:
It uses the remaining burst time to select which process to run at each step.
It continuously checks for processes that have arrived and can be executed (i.e., their arrival time is less than or equal to the current time).
It preempts the process with the shortest burst time, running it for 1 time unit, and updates its remaining burst time.
Once a process's remaining burst time becomes zero, it is marked as completed.
Calculating Times:
The program calculates the completion time, turnaround time (completion time - arrival time), and waiting time (turnaround time - burst time).
Output: The results (including average turnaround time and average waiting time) are printed in a table format.




--------------------------------------------------------------------



6) Implement the C program for CPU Scheduling Algorithms: Round Robin with 
different arrival time.

-->
The Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm is one of the simplest CPU scheduling algorithms. It assigns a fixed time quantum to each process in a cyclic order. Once a process uses up its time slice (quantum), it is preempted and placed back in the ready queue, and the next process in the queue gets the CPU.

In the context of Round Robin scheduling with different arrival times, we have to consider:

The processes arrive at different times, so they may not be in the ready queue initially.
The time quantum defines how long each process runs before being preempted.
We need to simulate the passage of time and track when processes arrive and when they are executed.
Key Concepts:
Arrival Time: The time at which a process becomes ready for execution.
Burst Time: The total CPU time required for the process to complete.
Time Quantum: The fixed time slice given to each process in a round-robin fashion.
Waiting Time: The total time a process has been in the ready queue.
Turnaround Time: The total time from arrival to completion (Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time).
Approach:
Input: The program takes the number of processes, arrival times, burst times, and a time quantum.
Scheduling: Implement the Round Robin algorithm where processes are scheduled in a circular manner.
Completion Calculation: Keep track of when each process starts and finishes execution.
Metrics Calculation: Calculate the waiting time and turnaround time for each process.

Explanation:
Process Structure:

Each process is represented as a structure containing its id, arrival_time, burst_time, remaining_time, completion_time, waiting_time, and turnaround_time.
Round Robin Scheduling:

Time Quantum: The program uses a fixed time quantum to run processes in a round-robin manner. The remaining burst time of a process is reduced by the time quantum after each execution cycle.
If a process still has remaining burst time after a time quantum, it is placed back in the ready queue.
No Process Ready: If no process is ready to execute at the current time, the simulation advances the current time by 1 unit.
Time Calculation:

Each process runs for a fixed time slice or until it finishes its remaining burst time. The turnaround time is the time from arrival to completion, and the waiting time is the time the process spends in the ready queue before starting execution.
Sorting:

The processes are sorted by arrival time before scheduling to ensure they are handled in the order they arrive.
Input and Output:

The program takes the number of processes, arrival times, burst times, and the time quantum as input.
It calculates and prints the completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time for each process.
Average Calculation:

The program calculates and prints the average waiting time and average turnaround time for all processes.

How It Works:
Process Execution: Each process executes for a fixed quantum of time (e.g., 2 units). The CPU starts by executing process 1. When the time quantum expires or the process finishes, it is placed back in the ready queue if there is remaining burst time.

Completion and Waiting Time Calculation:

Turnaround Time is calculated as the difference between the completion time and arrival time.
Waiting Time is calculated as the difference between turnaround time and burst time.
Average Calculation: The program calculates the average waiting and turnaround times for all processes.

6) Thread synchronization using counting semaphores. Application to demonstrate: 
producer consumer problem with counting semaphores and mutex.

-->

The Producer-Consumer Problem is a classic example of synchronization in multithreading where multiple producer threads are producing items and adding them to a shared buffer (queue), while multiple consumer threads are consuming items from the same buffer. We need to synchronize the producers and consumers so that they do not access the buffer simultaneously and also handle cases where the buffer is full or empty.

To solve this problem using counting semaphores and mutexes, we typically use two semaphores:

empty: Keeps track of the number of empty slots in the buffer.
full: Keeps track of the number of filled slots in the buffer.
mutex: A binary semaphore used to ensure mutual exclusion when accessing the shared buffer.
Counting Semaphores:
A counting semaphore is used to manage a resource that can be shared by multiple threads. It maintains a counter, and the wait() operation decrements the counter while the signal() operation increments it.
The empty semaphore is initialized to the size of the buffer (representing the number of empty slots available).
The full semaphore is initialized to 0 (because initially, the buffer is empty).
The mutex is initialized to 1 and is used to ensure only one thread accesses the buffer at a time.
Producer-Consumer Problem Solution Using Semaphores and Mutex
Below is a C program demonstrating this concept using POSIX threads and semaphores. The program simulates the producer-consumer problem where the producers and consumers share a circular buffer.

Explanation of the Code:
Shared Buffer:

A shared circular buffer buffer[] of size BUFFER_SIZE is used to store items.
Two pointers in and out track the next empty slot (for producer) and the next item to be consumed (for consumer), respectively.
Semaphores:

empty: Keeps track of the empty slots in the buffer. Initially set to BUFFER_SIZE (indicating that the buffer is empty).
full: Keeps track of the full slots in the buffer. Initially set to 0 (indicating that the buffer is empty).
mutex: A binary semaphore used to ensure mutual exclusion when accessing the shared buffer.
Producer:

The producer thread generates a random item, waits for an empty slot in the buffer (sem_wait(&empty)), enters the critical section using the mutex semaphore, inserts the item into the buffer, and then signals that a slot is full by posting to the full semaphore.
The producer sleeps for a random amount of time after producing an item to simulate the production process.
Consumer:

The consumer thread waits for a full slot in the buffer (sem_wait(&full)), enters the critical section, removes an item from the buffer, and then signals that an empty slot is available by posting to the empty semaphore.
The consumer sleeps for a random amount of time after consuming an item to simulate the consumption process.
Mutex for Mutual Exclusion:

The mutex semaphore ensures that only one thread (either producer or consumer) can access the buffer at a time, preventing race conditions.
Synchronization Details:
empty semaphore: This tracks the number of empty slots in the buffer. Producers decrement it when they insert an item, and consumers increment it when they consume an item.
full semaphore: This tracks the number of filled slots in the buffer. Consumers decrement it when they consume an item, and producers increment it when they produce an item.
mutex semaphore: This ensures that only one thread (either producer or consumer) accesses the buffer at any given time.
Key Features:
Producer-Consumer Synchronization: The producers and consumers are synchronized using semaphores to avoid issues like buffer overflows or underflows.
Mutex for Critical Section: A mutex is used to ensure mutual exclusion when accessing the shared buffer to prevent race conditions.
Counting Semaphores: Counting semaphores (empty and full) are used to keep track of available resources (buffer slots) and synchronize the producer and consumer threads.




-----------------------------------------------------------------



8) Thread synchronization and mutual exclusion using mutex. Application to 
demonstrate: Reader Writer problem with reader priority.

-->
The Reader-Writer problem is a classic synchronization problem where multiple threads (readers and writers) are accessing a shared resource (e.g., a database).

In the Reader-Writer problem with reader priority, readers are given priority, meaning multiple readers can access the shared resource simultaneously, but writers are only allowed when there are no readers or writers accessing the resource.

Key Points:
Reader Threads: Multiple readers can read the shared resource at the same time, provided there are no writers.
Writer Threads: Writers require exclusive access to the shared resource, meaning no readers or other writers can access the resource while a writer is writing.
Reader Priority: If a reader is waiting for the resource, it will be allowed to read before a writer can get access (this is in contrast to writer-priority scenarios where writers are given preference over readers).
Problem Requirements:
Mutual Exclusion: We need to ensure mutual exclusion when readers or writers access the shared resource.
Synchronization: We need to manage the reader and writer processes using synchronization primitives like mutexes and condition variables.
Solution Using Mutex:
We will use a mutex to protect the critical section and condition variables to manage the coordination between readers and writers.

mutex: Ensures mutual exclusion when modifying shared variables (e.g., the count of readers).
reader_lock: A condition variable used to block writers when there are readers.
writer_lock: A condition variable used to block readers when a writer is writing.

Explanation of the Code:
Shared Variables:

read_count: Tracks how many readers are currently reading. If read_count is positive, there are readers. If read_count == 0, no readers are active.
data: The shared resource being read or written by the threads.
Mutex and Condition Variables:

mutex: Ensures mutual exclusion when modifying read_count or accessing shared resources.
reader_lock: Ensures that no writers can write while readers are reading.
writer_lock: Ensures that no readers are allowed when a writer is writing.
Reader Thread:

The reader waits if any writer is writing (when read_count == -1).
Once allowed to read, it increments read_count and accesses the shared resource (data).
After finishing reading, it decrements read_count and signals a writer if there are no readers left.
Writer Thread:

The writer waits if there are any active readers (read_count > 0) or if another writer is writing (read_count == -1).
Once allowed to write, it sets read_count to -1 (indicating that it is writing), modifies the shared resource (data), and after writing, sets read_count back to 0.
Reader Priority:

The key feature of this solution is that readers are given priority. Writers have to wait for all readers to finish before they can start writing.
Key Features:
Reader Priority: The program gives priority to readers, meaning if there are waiting readers, they will be allowed to access the shared resource before a writer.
Synchronization: The program uses mutexes and condition variables to manage access to the shared resource and to prevent race conditions.
Mutual Exclusion: Only one thread (either a reader or a writer) can access the shared resource at a time, thanks to the mutex.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



9) Implement the C program forDeadlock Avoidance Algorithm: Bankers Algorithm:

-->
The Banker's Algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm that allocates resources to processes in such a way that the system is always in a safe state. A system is considered safe if there is at least one sequence of processes that does not cause deadlock.

In the Banker's Algorithm, the system makes decisions based on the concept of a safe sequence. The idea is to check whether a process can be allocated resources safely without putting the system in an unsafe state. If the allocation is safe, resources are allocated to the process; otherwise, they are denied.

Key Concepts:
Available Resources: The total resources minus the resources currently allocated.
Max Demand: The maximum number of resources that each process may need.
Allocated Resources: The resources that are currently allocated to each process.
Need Matrix: The remaining resources each process needs to complete (i.e., Need[i][j] = Max[i][j] - Allocated[i][j]).
Safe Sequence: A sequence of processes such that each process can be granted the resources it needs without leading to a deadlock.

Key Points:
Available Resources: The program asks the user to input the available resources, the maximum resource needs of each process, and the already allocated resources.
Safety Check: The isSafe function checks if the system is in a safe state by simulating the allocation of resources and checking if all processes can eventually finish.
Simplification: The code has been simplified to focus on the main logic, removing extra functions and complexity. The isSafe function uses the work array to simulate resource allocation and checks if all processes can be finished with the available resources.
Finite Input: The program takes input only once for the resources, the maximum demands, and the allocations, making it finite.
How the Code Works:
Initialization: The program takes the available resources, the maximum resource demands, and the currently allocated resources as input.
Need Matrix: The need matrix is computed by subtracting the allocated resources from the maximum demands (Need[i][j] = Max[i][j] - Allocated[i][j]).
Safety Check: The isSafe function simulates the process of allocating resources to each process while maintaining a safe state. If all processes can eventually finish without causing a deadlock, the system is considered in a safe state.

Explanation of the Output:
Available Resources: The user inputs the available resources as 3 2 2 (3 units of resource 1, 2 units of resource 2, and 2 units of resource 3).
Max Resources: The maximum resource needs for each process are inputted.
Allocated Resources: The already allocated resources for each process are inputted.
Safety Check: The system checks if there is a safe sequence and prints the result.

10) Implement the C program for Page Replacement Algorithms: FCFS for frame size as 
minimum three

-->
The First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) page replacement algorithm is one of the simplest page replacement strategies. It replaces the oldest page in memory with the new one when a page fault occurs.

Key Concepts:
Frame Size: The number of pages that can be held in memory.
Page Fault: Occurs when a requested page is not currently in memory.
Page Replacement: Replacing a page in memory when a new page needs to be loaded.

Key Points:
Page Fault Handling: When a page is not found in the frames, the program replaces the oldest page (based on the first-come-first-served order).
Frame Size: The frame size is fixed at 3 as per your requirement.
Circular Frame Replacement: We maintain the order of pages using the index variable, which is updated in a circular fashion (index = (index + 1) % FRAME_SIZE).
Output: The program outputs the current state of frames after each page access, showing either the page number or an 'X' to represent an empty frame.

Explanation:
The page reference string is {7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4}.
Initially, the frames are empty (X).
As pages are accessed, the frames are updated, and when a page is not found in the frames, it replaces the oldest one (FCFS).
Finally, the total number of page faults is displayed.
How to Compile and Run:
Save the code as fcfs_page_replacement.c.

Compile using GCC:



-------------------------------------------------------------------



11). Implement the C program for Page Replacement Algorithms: LRU for frame size as 
minimum three.

-->
 Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement algorithm implemented in C with a frame size of at least 3, as per your request. The program also includes the required print statement "By Onkar - T1905308657".

Key Concepts:
LRU Algorithm: The Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm replaces the page that has not been used for the longest period of time when a page fault occurs.
Frame Size: The number of pages that can be stored in memory at once (minimum of 3 in this case).
Page Fault: Occurs when the requested page is not in memory and needs to be loaded.

Key Points:
LRU Implementation:
When a page is accessed, if it's not already in memory, the program inserts it into the memory, replacing the least recently used (LRU) page.
The program determines the LRU page by shifting all pages to the left and placing the new page in the last position if all frames are full.
Frame Size: The frame size is fixed at 3, but this can easily be adjusted by changing the FRAME_SIZE constant.
Output: The program displays the state of the frames after every page access, showing either the page number or an 'X' to represent an empty frame.

Explanation:
Page Reference String: The example uses a page reference string {7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4}.
Frame Management: The program starts with empty frames and fills them according to the page reference string. If the requested page is not already in memory (a page fault), it will be added.
Page Faults: Whenever a page is not found in memory, it results in a page fault, and the LRU page is replaced.



---------------------------------------------------------------------



12) Implement the C program for Page Replacement Algorithms: Optimal for frame size 
as minimum three.

-->
Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm implemented in C. The Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in the future, making it the most optimal in terms of minimizing page faults. The code ensures that the frame size is at least 3.

Key Concepts:
Optimal Algorithm: It selects the page to replace that will not be used for the longest time in the future.
Frame Size: The number of pages that can be stored in memory (minimum of 3 in this case).
Page Fault: Occurs when the requested page is not in memory.

Key Points:
Optimal Page Replacement: The findOptimalPage function determines which page to replace by selecting the one that will not be used for the longest period of time in the future.
Frame Size: The frame size is fixed at 3, but you can adjust it by changing the FRAME_SIZE constant.
Page Fault Handling: If a page is not found in the frames, it is replaced based on the optimal algorithm.
Output: After each page reference, the current state of the frames is printed.


Certainly! Below is a simplified version of the Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm implemented in C. The Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in the future, making it the most optimal in terms of minimizing page faults. The code ensures that the frame size is at least 3.

Key Concepts:
Optimal Algorithm: It selects the page to replace that will not be used for the longest time in the future.
Frame Size: The number of pages that can be stored in memory (minimum of 3 in this case).
Page Fault: Occurs when the requested page is not in memory.
Simplified Optimal Page Replacement Code:
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

#define FRAME_SIZE 3

// Function to find the optimal page replacement index
int findOptimalPage(int frames[], int n, int pages[], int currentIndex) {
    int farthest = -1, indexToReplace = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < FRAME_SIZE; i++) {
        int j;
        for (j = currentIndex; j < n; j++) {
            if (frames[i] == pages[j]) {
                if (j > farthest) {
                    farthest = j;
                    indexToReplace = i;
                }

}
Key Points:
Optimal Page Replacement: The findOptimalPage function determines which page to replace by selecting the one that will not be used for the longest period of time in the future.
Frame Size: The frame size is fixed at 3, but you can adjust it by changing the FRAME_SIZE constant.
Page Fault Handling: If a page is not found in the frames, it is replaced based on the optimal algorithm.
Output: After each page reference, the current state of the frames is printed.
Sample Output:

Total Page Faults: 6
Explanation:
Page Reference String: The example uses the page reference string {7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4}.
Frame Management: The program starts with empty frames and fills them according to the page reference string. When a page fault occurs, the optimal page replacement algorithm selects the page to replace based on which page will not be used for the longest time in the future.
Page Faults: The program counts the number of page faults that occur during the page reference process.

13) FIFOS: Full duplex communication between two independent processes. First process 
accepts sentences and writes on one pipe to be read by second process and second 
process counts number of characters, number of words and number of lines in 
accepted sentences, writes this output in a text file and writes the contents of the file 
on second pipe to be read by first process and displays on standard output.

-->
Full Duplex Communication between two independent processes using FIFOs (named pipes). The first process accepts sentences from the user, writes them to a pipe, and the second process reads the sentences, counts the number of characters, words, and lines, writes the output to a file, and then sends the contents of that file back to the first process via another pipe. The first process then displays the result.

We will maintain the FIFOs for inter-process communication, and the program will be as small and simple as possible while achieving the desired functionality.

Full Duplex Communication using FIFOs (named pipes)

Explanation of the Code:
Pipes Creation:

mkfifo(PIPE1, 0666) creates two named pipes: PIPE1 (for communication from Process 1 to Process 2) and PIPE2 (for communication from Process 2 to Process 1).
Process 1:

process1() accepts sentences from the user (via fgets), writes the sentences to PIPE1, and waits for Process 2's output via PIPE2.
The output from Process 2 (which includes counts for characters, words, and lines) is read from PIPE2 and displayed on the standard output.
Process 2:

process2() reads the sentences from PIPE1, counts characters, words, and lines, writes the result to a temporary file (/tmp/output.txt), and then reads the contents of that file and sends it back through PIPE2 to Process 1.
Forking:

fork() creates two processes. The child process executes process2(), while the parent process executes process1().

Explanation of Sample Output:
Process 1 accepts sentences from the user and sends them to Process 2.
Process 2 counts the number of characters, words, and lines in the input, writes the result to a file, and then sends the contents back to Process 1.
Process 1 displays the contents of the file received from Process 2.

14)  Inter-process Communication using Shared Memory using System V. Application to 
demonstrate: Client and Server Programs in which server process creates a shared 
memory segment and writes the message to the shared memory segment. Client 
process reads the message from the shared memory segment and displays it to the 
screen.

-->
Explanation of the Code
Explanation: 1. server
Shared Memory Segment Creation (shmget): The shmget function is used to create or access a shared memory segment. Here, IPC_CREAT is used to create the segment if it doesn't exist, and 0666 sets the permission to read/write for both user and group.

Attach to Shared Memory (shmat): The shmat function attaches the shared memory segment to the address space of the process, so the process can read/write to it. If the function call is successful, it returns a pointer to the memory area. If it fails, it returns (char *) -1.

Write to Shared Memory: The strncpy function is used to copy a message ("Hello from the server!") into the shared memory. It ensures that the message does not exceed the size of the shared memory (defined by SHM_SIZE).

Detachment from Shared Memory (shmdt): After writing the message, the process detaches from the shared memory using shmdt. This makes the memory no longer available to the server process, but it can still be accessed by others.

2. client

Shared Memory Segment Access (shmget): Similar to the server, the client uses shmget to access the shared memory segment created by the server. The client does not need to create the memory segment (i.e., no IPC_CREAT), it only needs access.

Attach to Shared Memory (shmat): The client attaches to the shared memory segment using shmat, which returns a pointer to the shared memory. If it fails, it returns (char *) -1.

Read from Shared Memory: Once attached to the shared memory, the client can read the data stored by the server. In this case, it reads the message "Hello from the server!" and prints it.

Detachment from Shared Memory (shmdt): The client detaches from the shared memory using shmdt, just as the server does after using it.

15) Implement the C program for Disk Scheduling Algorithms: SSTF considering the 
initial head position moving away from the spindle

-->
 Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) disk scheduling algorithm. The SSTF algorithm selects the disk request that is closest to the current disk head position. The goal of the algorithm is to minimize the seek time by always choosing the request that requires the least amount of movement of the disk head.

Program Breakdown:
1. Input:
The program starts by asking the user to enter:
The number of requests (n).
The disk requests (a list of integer values, each representing a track on the disk that needs to be accessed).
The initial position of the disk head.
2. SSTF Disk Scheduling:
The function sstf() implements the Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF) algorithm.
The main idea of the SSTF algorithm is to move the disk head to the request that is closest (i.e., has the minimum seek time), after each move.
The process is repeated until all requests are served.
3. Detailed Steps:
Initialization:

An array completed[MAX_REQUESTS] is used to keep track of which requests have been served. Initially, all elements are set to 0 (indicating that no requests have been completed yet).
The current head position is initialized to the input value initial.
A variable total_seek is used to keep track of the total seek time.
SSTF Logic:

For each request, the program looks for the closest request to the current head position:
It calculates the seek distance (abs(requests[j] - current)) for each uncompleted request.
It keeps track of the minimum distance and selects the request that is closest.
Once a request is served, the program updates the current head position to the track number of the served request.
The corresponding request is marked as completed (i.e., completed[index] = 1).
The total seek time is updated by adding the distance moved to the total_seek variable.
It prints the track number that was served and the new head position after serving each request.

Key Concepts:
Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF):

SSTF selects the disk request closest to the current position of the disk head. It tries to minimize the seek time by always choosing the request with the shortest distance.
This method works well if the requests are distributed uniformly. However, it can lead to the starvation problem, where some requests (especially those that are far away) may never get served.
Seek Time:

Seek time refers to the time it takes for the disk's head to move to the desired track. It is the absolute difference between the current position and the requested track position.
Total Seek Time:

The total seek time is the sum of all the seek times for each request, representing the total time spent moving the disk head.

16) Implement the C program for Disk Scheduling Algorithms: SCAN considering the 
initial head position moving away from the spindle.

--> 
What is Disk Scheduling?
When we have a hard disk or any storage device with multiple locations (tracks), the disk head (like a needle on a record player) needs to move to different positions to read or write data. The goal of disk scheduling is to decide the order in which the disk head will serve requests to access the tracks.

SCAN Disk Scheduling Algorithm:
The SCAN algorithm moves the disk head in one direction (either towards higher or lower numbered tracks), serves all the requests in that direction, then reverses and serves the remaining requests in the opposite direction. It's similar to how an elevator works: it moves in one direction, serves the requested floors, and when it reaches the end, it changes direction.

How This Program Works:
Input:
Number of Requests: How many tracks (requests) need to be served.
Request List: The actual track numbers that need to be accessed.
Initial Head Position: Where the disk head starts.
Direction: Whether the head should move "up" (toward higher track numbers) or "down" (toward lower track numbers).
Steps:
Sort the Requests: First, we sort the request list so that we can serve them in an orderly fashion.
Move in the Given Direction: If the direction is "up" (1), the head will first move to the right (towards higher track numbers) and serve requests in that direction.
Change Direction: Once the head reaches the last track in the given direction, it turns around and moves in the opposite direction, serving any remaining requests.
Print the Total Seek Time: This is the total distance the head moves to serve all requests.

Key Points:
Sorting: The requests are sorted to make the movement of the head smoother (from lower to higher track numbers or vice versa).
Direction Handling: If the direction is up (1), the head moves toward higher numbers first. After reaching the highest request, it moves back down to the lowest request.
Seek Time Calculation: We calculate the total seek time, which is the total distance the head moves to serve all requests.
Output: After each request is served, the current position of the head is printed. Finally, the total seek time is shown.

Conclusion:
This program demonstrates the SCAN algorithm for disk scheduling, where the head serves requests in one direction, then reverses and serves requests in the opposite direction. It helps to minimize the number of movements the disk head has to make.

17) Implement the C program for Disk Scheduling Algorithms: C-Look considering the 
initial head position moving away from the spindle.

-->
What is C-LOOK Disk Scheduling?
C-LOOK (Circular LOOK) is a disk scheduling algorithm that is similar to the LOOK algorithm, but instead of reversing direction after reaching the last request, the disk head jumps directly to the first request and continues serving. This reduces unnecessary backtracking.

In the C-LOOK algorithm:

The disk head moves in one direction (either towards higher or lower tracks) until it reaches the last request.
Once it reaches the end of the requests, it jumps back to the first request and continues servicing in the same direction.
Code Walkthrough
Input:

The program first asks for the number of requests.
Then, it accepts the track numbers that need to be accessed.
Finally, it takes the initial head position, which is where the disk head starts.
Sorting:

The list of track requests is sorted in ascending order to make the movement of the disk head more efficient.
Main Logic:

First, the disk head serves all requests that are greater than or equal to the current position.
After serving the last request, the disk head jumps to the first track and continues serving the remaining requests.
Seek Time Calculation:

The program calculates and prints the total seek time, which is the total distance the disk head moves to serve all requests.
Output:

For each served request, the program prints the request and the current head position.
Finally, it prints the total seek time.

Explanation of Key Steps:
Sorting the Requests:

The requests are sorted in ascending order to ensure the head moves from the lower to the higher track numbers.
Servicing Requests in C-LOOK Style:

The head first moves to the right (toward higher track numbers), serving requests greater than or equal to the current position.
Once the head has reached the last request, it jumps to the first request and continues serving in the same direction (to the right).
Seek Time Calculation:

The seek time is the total distance the head moves. Each time the head serves a request, the distance is added to total_seek.
Output:

The program prints each request served along with the current head position.
Finally, it prints the total seek time.
